# Problem 1: Counting the Layers of a Sandwich
# Understand 
# Is the given input always in a list format?
# Is the list consist a neested list?
# Is there a time or space complexity constraint?
# What should we do when the list is empty or contain only 1 element?

# Plan
# Check for base cases, return 0 when the length of the list is 0, and 1 when it equal to 1.
# Recursively return 1 + count_layers(list[1])
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n) 
# Implement

# Understand

# Check base cases: return an empty string when len(orders) equal 0.
# Base case: return the element at index 0, when len(orders) equal 1.
# Recursively return helper(order[1:]) + " " + order[0]
# Inside the main function:
# Split the given input into a list format and save it to a variable call word.
# call the helper function passing the word variable as parameter.
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n) 
# Implement
