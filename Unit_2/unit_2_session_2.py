# Problem 1: Most Endangered Species

# Understand
# What should we return when the dictionary is empty?
# What should we do when there is a tie?
# What is the format of the input? is it a list? or a dictionary?
# Is there a time or space complexity constrain?

# Plan
# Declare a variable called lowest to track the lowest population seeing so far. Initialize it to +infinity.
# Define a string variable to track the name of the specie with lowest population. Initialize it as empty.
# Iterate over the given list of species, assigne the population of the current specie to a variable called current_population.
# If current_population is lower than the lowest variable, update the lowest variable to current_population,
# And assigne the name of the current specie to the variable name_Of_specie_with_lowest_population.
# Return name_Of_specie_with_lowest_population.
# Time complexity: O(n), since we need to scan all element present in the list.
# Space complexity: O(1), no extra space used, we are only declaring variable.
