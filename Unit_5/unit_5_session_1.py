# Advanced Problem Set Version 1

# Problem 3: Group by Personality

# Understand
# Is the constructor always given?
# What should we do when the list of townies is empty?
# What should we return when their is no match?
# Is there a time or space complexity constraint?

# Plan
# Declare a result variable to store the final output.
# Iterate over the townies list, append the name of the townie if townie.personality == personality_type.
# Otherwise, skip
# Return result list. 
# Time complexity: best case is O(1) if townie contain only one element, worse case is O(n) where n is the number of townies.
# Space complexity: O(1) since we did not allocate any extra space.
